# More About Me

I was born and raised in Holdenville, Oklahoma — a small town that teaches you big things about people. From there, I went to Jackson College of Ministries in Jackson, Mississippi, where I studied the Word and figured out what I wanted to do with my life. After graduating, I taught at Texas Bible College, then my wife and I did the thing everyone tells you is crazy: we planted a church in Seattle, Washington.

Thirteen years later, I can confirm — it was crazy. And worth every minute.

## My Family

I'm a husband to Brittani Scott — singer, songwriter, recording artist, and worship leader. She's the talented one. I just married well.

We have two little girls: Asha and Yerrin. They are my pride and joy and the reason I drink coffee.

## Motivation

I believe every minister on the planet is called to reach the world. Not just their corner of it — the whole thing.

Church planting should be at the heart of that mission. Going to unchurched areas. Bringing the gospel to places that don't have it yet. That's the work.

I'm obsessed with the *methods* — the strategies, the systems, the creative ways we plant the seed of the gospel. Technology. One-on-one conversations. Home Bible studies. Whatever it takes to get the message where it needs to go.

The tools change. The mission doesn't.

## Goals

Life has us in South Dakota right now, helping with ministry here as we transition away from Seattle. We're not entirely sure where the road takes us next — and honestly, that's kind of exciting.

What I do know: we want to pastor a church again. And wherever we land, we'll be planting works in unreached communities within reach. That's non-negotiable.

## What I Do for Fun

I'm a technology nerd. Gadgets, entrepreneurship, the cutting edge of AI and its impact on our work — that's my version of relaxation. I love learning about marketing strategy the way some people love fantasy football.

I also scuba dive. I'm a Kansas City Chiefs fan. I collect journals (yes, physical ones — there's something about a blank page).

Teaching is genuinely a hobby for me. I love the creative work of publishing — writing, video, audio. I love the whole process of making something and putting it into the world.

I love music of all kinds. And as much as time allows, I like to golf. I didn't say I was *good* at it.
